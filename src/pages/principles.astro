          The thinking behind the systems.

          <!-- Principle 1 -->
          <div>
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.953rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              1. Ownership vs. Delegation in Systems
            </h2>
            <div style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Delegation works for tasks. Ownership is required for systems.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                When you delegate system building, you get features delivered to specification. When you assign ownership, you get systems that solve problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                The difference is in the thinking: delegated work follows instructions; owned work questions assumptions, anticipates edge cases, and considers long-term implications. A system owner doesn't just build what was asked—they build what's needed, even if it differs from the initial request.
              </p>
            </div>

          <!-- Principle 2 -->
          <div>
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.953rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              2. Why Stability Precedes Scale
            </h2>
            <div style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Scaling a broken system just gives you more broken things faster.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Before thinking about handling 10x the load or 10x the users, a system must work reliably at 1x. This seems obvious, but it's often overlooked in the rush to add features or accommodate growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stability means: the system works consistently under normal conditions, errors are handled gracefully, data is never lost, and performance is predictable. Once stability is proven, then and only then should scaling be considered.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Principle 3 -->
          <div>
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.953rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              3. When Spreadsheets Fail (and What Comes Next)
            </h2>
            <div style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Spreadsheets are incredible tools—until they're not. The failure points are predictable:
              </p>
              <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">When multiple people need to edit simultaneously</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">When data comes from multiple sources</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">When processes become complex with many steps</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">When real-time data is needed</li>
                <li>When errors have significant consequences</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The next step isn't necessarily a complex enterprise system. Often, it's a simple, focused internal tool that solves the specific failure point while keeping everything else the same.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Principle 4 -->
          <div>
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.953rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              4. Building for Daily Use, Not Demos
            </h2>
            <div style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Demo-quality systems are optimized for first impressions. Production systems are optimized for the hundredth use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The difference shows up in error handling, loading states, data validation, edge cases, and performance under real-world conditions. A system built for daily use assumes things will go wrong and handles them gracefully. It prioritizes reliability over flashiness, and utility over novelty.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <!-- Principle 5 -->
          <div>
            <h2 style="font-size: 1.953rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              5. Responsible Evolution (Not Scope Creep)
            </h2>
            <div style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                All systems evolve. The question is whether evolution is controlled or chaotic.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Scope creep happens when new features are added without considering their impact on the overall system architecture, maintainability, or performance. Responsible evolution means each change is evaluated against the system's goals and architecture, and implemented in a way that maintains or improves system integrity.
              </p>
              <p>
                This doesn't mean systems never change. It means change is intentional, documented, and preserves what works while carefully adding what's needed.
              </p>
