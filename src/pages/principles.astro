            <p class="text-large mb-64">
                The thinking behind the systems.
            </p>

            <div class="mb-64">
                <h2 class="mb-24" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border); padding-bottom: 16px;">
                    1. Ownership vs. Delegation in Systems
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-16">
                    Delegation works for tasks with clear boundaries. Systems—especially internal ones—have fluid boundaries. What starts as a reporting tool becomes a decision engine, then integrates with operations, then needs real-time updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ownership means one person understands the whole, sees connections before they become problems, and evolves the system intentionally rather than reactively.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-64">
                <h2 class="mb-24" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border); padding-bottom: 16px;">
                    2. Why Stability Precedes Scale
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-16">
                    A system that works reliably for 10 users but fails unpredictably for 100 is worse than one that works for 5 users consistently. Scale reveals architectural flaws, but instability destroys trust.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We build for the current reality plus one order of magnitude. When that's stable, we scale again. Not before.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-64">
                <h2 class="mb-24" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border); padding-bottom: 16px;">
                    3. When Spreadsheets Fail (and What Comes Next)
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-16">
                    Spreadsheets are perfect until they're not. The failure signals: multiple people editing, version confusion, manual data entry errors, formulas breaking silently, decision delays waiting for "the spreadsheet person."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next step isn't a bigger spreadsheet. It's a system with: single source of truth, controlled access, automated data flows, validation, and audit trails.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-64">
                <h2 class="mb-24" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border); padding-bottom: 16px;">
                    4. Building for Daily Use, Not Demos
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Demo-ware is optimized for first impressions. Production systems are optimized for the 1000th use. This means: loading states, error recovery, data validation, performance under real data volumes, clear error messages, and intuitive workflows for tired users at 4 PM.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-64">
                <h2 class="mb-24" style="border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border); padding-bottom: 16px;">
                    5. Responsible Evolution (Not Scope Creep)
                </h2>
                <p class="mb-16">
                    Systems evolve or die. But evolution without architecture is cancer—features added wherever they fit, complexity growing exponentially.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Responsible evolution means: understanding the cost of each feature, preserving conceptual integrity, and saying "not now" more often than "yes."
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card mt-64">
                <h2 class="mb-16">These principles guide every system we build.</h2>
                <p class="mb-32">
                    They're not abstract philosophy—they're practical constraints that produce better outcomes. If your challenge aligns with this thinking, we should talk.
