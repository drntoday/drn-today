                Single-point accountability for systems that matter.

                <h2 class="mb-24">Why One Builder Beats an Agency</h2>
                <p class="mb-24">
                    Agencies optimize for billable hours and smooth hand-offs. They delegate, they rotate teams, they create documentation for the next person. This works for marketing sites, but fails for internal systems that need to work daily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One accountable builder means: <strong>no knowledge loss</strong>, <strong>no responsibility diffusion</strong>, <strong>no excuses</strong>. When something breaks, there's exactly one person who understands it completely and fixes it.

                <ul style="color: var(--text-secondary); padding-left: 24px;">
                    <li class="mb-16"><strong>No hand-offs:</strong> The person who architects also builds, also deploys, also maintains.</li>
                    <li class="mb-16"><strong>Long-term thinking:</strong> Building for maintainability because I'll be the one maintaining it.</li>
                    <li class="mb-16"><strong>Direct communication:</strong> No account managers, no project managers, no layers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skin in the game:</strong> My reputation depends on your system working, not just being delivered.</li>

                <h2 class="mb-24">What "Founder-Built" Actually Means</h2>
                <p class="mb-24">
                    It doesn't mean I only work with founders (though I often do). It means I build systems with the same ownership mindset a founder has for their business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I treat your system like it's my own: caring about the details, anticipating problems, and committing to its long-term success. This is the opposite of contractor mentality.
