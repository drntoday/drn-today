          Single-point accountability for systems that matter.

              Why One Builder Beats an Agency
            </h2>
            <div style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Agencies delegate. Freelancers deliver features. Builders own systems end-to-end.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                When you work with an agency, your project gets handed off: sales to account manager, account manager to project manager, project manager to developer, developer to QA. At each hand-off, context is lost, ownership is diluted, and accountability becomes collective—which means no one is truly accountable.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a single builder, there's one point of contact, one person who understands the system completely, and one person responsible for its success or failure. This eliminates hand-off friction, ensures consistent vision, and creates clear accountability.

              The Accountability Difference
            </h2>
            <div style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                Accountability means more than just delivering code. It means:
              </p>
              <ul style="padding-left: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Understanding the business problem, not just the technical requirement</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Designing for the long term, not just the immediate deliverable</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Being available when things break, not just when building new features</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Documenting decisions and trade-offs so the system can be understood</li>
                <li>Maintaining what's built, not abandoning it for the next project</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This level of accountability transforms the relationship from vendor-client to partnership. When I build your system, I'm invested in its success because my reputation is tied to its performance.
              </p>

              From First Line to Long-Term Maintenance
            </h2>
            <div style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                The value of a system isn't just in its initial build—it's in its evolution and maintenance over time. Systems that work today need to adapt tomorrow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because I'm the only person who touches the code, I understand it completely. This means faster iterations, safer changes, and more efficient maintenance. There's no need to bring a new team up to speed, no lost tribal knowledge, and no "that's how the previous developer did it" mysteries.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div style="padding: 2rem; background: var(--color-bg-surface); border: 1px solid var(--color-border); border-radius: 6px;">
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.563rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
              What "Founder-Built" Actually Means
            </h3>
            <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              It means systems are built with the same care, attention, and long-term thinking that you apply to your business. No shortcuts that create technical debt. No features that don't serve the core need. No delivery without understanding the why.
